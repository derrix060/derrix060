# üëã Hi, I'm Mario!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This README is here to help you get to know my working style and how we can collaborate effectively.

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Work Style

- **Flexible Schedule:** I don't have a fixed work schedule. Some days I work in the mornings, others in the evenings, and sometimes I split my hours.
- **Async First:** I work best with asynchronous communication. Please don't hesitate to send me a message even if I'm not online, I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
- **Best Way to Reach Me:** Slack is my preferred communication tool. Email is for last-resort or formal matters.

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Working Style (In Depth)

- **Deep Work & Meetings:**  
  I don't have a preferred time for focused work, but I like to block out large chunks of each day for deep work and schedule meetings around the same time or day. If you need my attention quickly, tagging me in Slack works well. For more serious or sensitive matters, feel free to send me a private message.

- **Availability & Boundaries:**  
  My schedule is unpredictable: I might message you at 3am, 6am, noon or 10pm. Please don't feel pressured to reply outside your own working hours! I respect everyone's boundaries and never expect immediate responses to after-hours messages.

- **Task & Project Management:**  
  I don't rely on any specific tools, but a basic kanban board goes a long way. I prioritize tasks based on impact, urgency, and deadlines, but I'm always open to discussing shifting priorities if something urgent comes up.

- **Collaboration & Problem-Solving:**  
  I like to start discussions asynchronously (Slack or GitHub issues), then jump on a quick call if we need to hash things out in real-time. I'm happy to pair for tricky problems, but I also enjoy solo deep-dives-just let me know what works for you!

- **Communication Preferences:**  
  Clear, concise messages with all relevant context help me respond quickly and accurately. Threaded conversations on Slack keep things organized. If something is urgent, tag me directly and use ‚Äúurgent‚Äù in your message to get my immediate attention.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Communication

- **Direct & Approachable:** I believe in open, direct communication. No politics, just honesty and respect.
- **Feedback Friendly:** I love receiving feedback and don't take things personally. If you have preferences for how you like to communicate or collaborate, let me know!
- **Raise Concerns Freely:** If you have a concern or suggestion, reach out directly. I appreciate transparency and constructive conversations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Reviews

- **Lots of Comments ‚â† Bad Code:** I tend to leave many comments on GitHub reviews. These are suggestions or clarifications, not criticisms.
- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking:** Most comments are non-blocking. If I approve your PR, it's good to go; suggestions can be addressed later. If I request changes, I'll clearly explain which are blockers and which can wait.
- **No Approval/No Changes Requested:** If I neither approve nor request changes, it means I'm not confident enough to decide. Feel free to discuss or seek another reviewer.

## üìÖ Meetings

- **Short & Focused:** I prefer brief, purpose-driven meetings. Async updates are always welcome.
- **Partial Participation is Okay:** If I can't contribute for the whole meeting, I may join for just the relevant part or multitask. Please call my name if you need my input.  If you need my attention at the whole meeting, please let me know.

## üß† My Approach to Learning & Mistakes

- **Learning:** I'm always eager to learn-whether it's through reading, experimenting, or pairing up.
- **Mistakes:** I see mistakes as opportunities to improve. If I make one, let's talk openly and fix it together.
- **Growth:** I value constructive criticism and am happy to give and receive it respectfully.
